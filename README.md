## Transparent Phishing Email Detection System

### Overview
This project focuses on identifying phishing-related indicators in email data
and explaining *why* an email is considered risky.  
Instead of treating phishing detection as a black-box classification task,
the system emphasizes transparency and feature-level analysis.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to study common phishing patterns such as:
- Suspicious sender domains
- Abnormal email headers
- Malicious or misleading URLs
- Content-based social engineering signals

This approach is intended for **educational and academic learning**.

### Key Characteristics
- Focus on feature analysis rather than only prediction accuracy
- Explainable decision logic
- Designed as a learning-focused security project
- No production or real-world deployment intent

### Technologies (Planned)
- Python
- Email feature extraction techniques
- Basic machine learning concepts (educational)

### Note
This project is an independent academic exercise inspired by
public cybersecurity research and common phishing detection methodologies.
