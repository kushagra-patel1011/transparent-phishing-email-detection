# 🛡️ Transparent Phishing Email Detection System

An educational cybersecurity project focused on analyzing phishing indicators
in email data and explaining **why** an email may be considered risky.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores how phishing emails can be identified by examining
multiple technical and behavioral indicators instead of relying on a
black-box prediction alone.

The system is designed for **learning and academic analysis**, not production use.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Analyzes

- 📧 Email header anomalies (sender mismatch, metadata issues)
- 🔗 Suspicious or misleading URLs
- 📝 Content-based social engineering patterns
- ⚠️ Combined risk signals to assess phishing likelihood

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

> Detection is useful, but **explanation builds understanding**.

Instead of only labeling emails as *phishing* or *safe*, this project highlights
the indicators that influenced the decision, supporting transparency and learning.
